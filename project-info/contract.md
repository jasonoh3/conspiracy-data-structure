# Team Contract

## Communication

### Team Meetings

Our team will meet once a week every Saturday from __12:00 PM CST to 12:30 PM CST__. We will use __Discord__ as software for team meetings. The purpose of these meetings will be mainly to check on individual progress and incentivise individual work towards project goals. We will folder in the repo with weekly notes that we will append a paragraph to each weekly meeting.

### Assistance

To provide adequate resources for team members, we will create __a Discord channel specifically dedicated to getting support__. Based on the historical response times on our server, one should expect an average response time of __~1 hour__ on the support channel.

### Respect

We will ensure respect within the team by __allocating time slots for each member to speak during meetings__. The student with netID __ethanbg2__ is the __dedicated respect overseer, whose responsibility is solely to ensure respect throughout the team__. __By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering tot he decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them__.

## Collaboration

### Work Distribution

The necessary tasks for the project will be divided in abstract before starting the project. Each week as the project focuses we will determine the necessary tasks in order to finish each component of the project in a timely manner. Each group member will choose the component that they would like to work on. If no team members volunteer to work on a component, we will use [Random.org](http://www.random.org) to decide assignments. These components will be as disjoint as possible to prevent merge conflicts. When components need to be merged with some glue code, this will be accomplished by allocating additional time during the team meeting.

### Time Commitment

Group members (the undersigned) are responsible for working __2 to 10 hours per week__. If work exceeds this limit, group members should communicate in the support channel and redistribute if necessary.

### Conflict Resolution

If team members have not accomplished their tasks, we will discuss this at the team meeting and redistribute tasks if necessary. If team members are habitually late, we will discuss rescheduling the meeting time to be more agreeable. If the team member is still noncompliant after redistribution and/or rescheduling, the team member will be reported and annexed if necessary. Conflicts about project details will be decided through discussion and resolution within 24 hours.
